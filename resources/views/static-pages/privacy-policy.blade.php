                    <p>Whenever there is a disagreement, the Buyer can write to customer-indiherbo@gmail.com, in order to raise a dispute. Disputes can be raised at a particular transaction level.</p>
                    <p style="color: #103178;"><b>Types of 'Disputes':</b></p>
                    <p>Following are the indicative examples of potential disputes:
                       Wrong item received <br> <br>
                       Item not as described <br> <br>
                       Damaged or Seal broken on Product <br> <br>
                       Part/Accessory missing <br> <br>
                       Item not Compatible <br> <br>
                       Seller Description/Specification Wrong <br> <br>
                       Defective (Functional issues) <br> <br>
                       Product not working and Manufacturer claims invalid Invoice <br> <br>
                       In case the Seller rejects the return request of the Buyer, and Buyer raises a dispute, then Indiherbo will try to mediate and resolve the dispute between both the parties. If the dispute is resolved in favor of the Buyer, a refund is provided once the product is returned to the Seller. If the dispute is settled in favor of the Seller, Buyer is entitled to any refund. <br> <br>
                       Raising disputes against Sellers does not automatically entitle the Buyer to a refund or replacement for the product purchased. Indiherbo shall verify the disputes so raised and may process only such claims that are valid and genuine. <br> <br>
                       Indiherbo shall at no point be responsible for any direct or indirect losses, expenses, costs of any nature whatsoever that may be incurred by any Buyer/Seller. <br> <br>
                       Claims of the nature of 'Buyer remorse' (i.e. instances where products are bought by the Buyer by mistake or where the Buyer chooses to change his/her mind with regard to the product purchased by him) will not be entertained. <br> <br>
                       Indiherbo reserves its right to initiate civil and/or criminal proceedings against a User who, files an invalid and/or false claims or provides false, incomplete, or misleading information. In addition to the legal proceedings as aforesaid, Indiherbo may at its sole discretion suspend, block, restrict, cancel the Display Name [and its related Display Names] of such User and/or disqualify that user and any related users. <br> <br>
                       Decisions made by Indiherbo shall be final and binding on its Users. <br> <br>
                       Indiherbo Customer Support Team may seek additional information / clarification from Buyer to facilitate resolution of the dispute. In the event Buyer does not respond with information / clarification sought within 10 days of such request, the dispute shall be auto-closed in favor of the Seller. <br>
